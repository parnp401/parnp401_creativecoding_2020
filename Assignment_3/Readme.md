# Assignment 3

The details of my projects are still flexible and very likely to change. 

## Project 1 ##

The first project is all about Synaesthesia, a neurological phenomenom that combines colors with senses. The visual effect in the head is different everytime it happens, yet the color scheme is limited and cannot be affected by the person. This is the perfect starting point for a generative design project with sound. 

### 1. Who is the user? ###

The target group of this project are students between 17 and 28, who don't know anything about synaesthesia. Hopefully, some will realize that they actually have synaesthesia, which happened to me too. 

### 2. What do you want them to experience? ###

I want them to experience the generative effects of synaesthesia in an interactive way. Users will be able to interact using sound, words and numbers. The key learning should be: Synaesthesia is different for every person who has it and even for 

### 3. How will your translation achieve this? ###

Users can affect the outcome by adding sound or typing letters or words. They can also change the view, which allows them to look inside the brain of a person with synaesthesia.
