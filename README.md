# parnp401_creativecoding_2020: Bio

I'm Patricia, a Design & Technology studio with a passion for the environment. With a marketing and communication degree in my pocket, I started my Master's journey in New York last year. As most of my projects were related to business, I aim to create something more artistic now, probably linked to Fine Arts. You can surprise me with a cup of coffee and cute dogs.
