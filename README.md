# parnp401_creativecoding_2020: Bio

I'm Patricia, a Design & Technology studio with a passion for the environment. With a marketing and communication degree in my pocket, I started my Master's journey in New York last year. As most projects were related to business, I aim to create something more artistic now, probably linked to Fine Arts.
